					TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth
					Spreading. Started in 1984 as a conference where Technology,
					Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost
					all topics from science to business to global issues, in
					more than 100 languages. The two annual TED Conferences
					invite the world&apos;s leading thinkers and doers to speak
					for 18 minutes or less. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx
					events help to share ideas in communities around the world.
					TED has become a global phenomenon, influencing how people
					consume information and inspiring them to think critically
					about the world around them. The diverse range of speakers
					and topics covered in TED Talks has contributed to its
					widespread popularity and impact.
