          together to share ideas worth spreading. These events are licensed by
          TED, a nonprofit organization devoted to &quot;Ideas Worth
          Spreading.&quot; TEDx events are designed to create a TED-like
          experience at the local level, allowing communities around the world

          operate independently, and the content and opinions expressed in TEDx
          talks are those of the speakers and not necessarily endorsed by TED.

          TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
          Started in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and
          Design converged, and today covers almost all topics from science to
          business to global issues, in more than 100 languages. The two annual
          TED Conferences invite the world&apos;s leading thinkers and doers to
          speak for 18 minutes or less. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events
          help to share ideas in communities around the world. TED has become a
          global phenomenon, influencing how people consume information and
          inspiring them to think critically about the world around them. The
          diverse range of speakers and topics covered in TED Talks has
          contributed to its widespread popularity and impact.
